# Convolutional-Neural-Network-using-SystemVerilog

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **SystemVerilog** to recognize **handwritten digits** (0â€“9), such as those from the MNIST dataset.

---

## ðŸ§  Architecture

The model includes:
- Convolution Layer
- ReLU Activation
- Max Pooling
- Fully Connected Layer


The testbench's images are taken from MNIST digits dataset.

All weights and reference calculated by "cnn_model.py"


# Simulation Results:
 I have taken the digit-2 for the testbench

The index of the highest number among the 10 classes is the output (i.e., argmax is used to determine the output).
